				<h2>How does LearnEmp work?</h2>
				<p>LearnEmp is a social crowdfunding platform for students who cannot afford higher education in a required university or course.LearnEmp enables donor to check a student's potential and accomplishments and make a contribution in order to help and empower the student.</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>Will the donor be paid back?</h2>
				<p>The donor is not paid back. LearnEmp works on the principle of 'Pay it Forward Loans'.When a donor makes a contribution towards a student in need, he/she will automatically oblige the student in question to make a contribution in the future to fund and help another student in need. It's all about ensuring a better future delivered by the promising students on roll.</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>How much should I donate?</h2>
				<p>When you have browsed through our list of students in need of funding, you can pick any-one and donate any amount you prefer. The minimum amount is $5 (Rs.300*). On every student's page you can view the funding required and how much the student has been already funded. You will receive a letter of gratitude from the student and LearnEmp for your contribution.</p>
